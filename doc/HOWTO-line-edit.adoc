\ Dissecting line-edit feature

You can use line editing on gosh REPL if the terminal is capable.  The
feature is implemented entirely in Gauche itself, instead of relying on
external libraries such as libreadline.  This document describes the
internals of the line editing feature for those who want to fix bugs
or add new features.

## Modules involved in the line editing feature

There are number of modules involved in this feature.

- `gauche.interactive.editable-reader` : This module is autoloaded
   when `gosh` is invoked in the interactive mode.  First it tries to
   obtain a default console (`text.console`), and if it succeeds, create
   a line editor instance (`text.line-edit`) and returns several procedures
   to be called from `read-eval-print-loop`.  If it can't get a default
   console (e.g. the termianl is not capable, or the stdios are connected
   to non-terminal device), then it returns false values and
   `read-eval-print-loop` falls back to a basic I/O without editing
   capability.
   This module also calls load/save edit history API in the appropriate
   time.

- `text.console`: This module provides an abstract API to control consoles
   such as cursor placements.
   Currently it supports VT100-compatible console and Windows console.
   It used to be a standard to use termcap/terminfo to abstract the device
   difference, and curses for high-level console manipulations.  However,
   the world has moved on.  We no longer have wide variations of terminal
   controls, so that adding dependencies to those external libraries is
   overkill.  Besides, Windows console requires totally different controls
   than the traditional Unix consoles.  So we decided to roll our own.

- `text.line-edit`: This module effectively implements a text editor.
   It uses `text.gap-buffer` for the buffer structure and `data.ring-buffer`
   for the kill ring.  It uses `text.console` for drawing, so it is
   independent from the actual console device.  It also supports
   unlimied undoing, and save/load histories.

- `text.gap-buffer`: Implements a gap buffer, suitable for the back-end
   of text editor.

## Startup sequence - what happens before you get `gosh$` prompt

The main program of `gosh` calls `user#read-eval-print-loop` if no
script file is given.  If `-q` option is given to `gosh`, it is
`gauche#read-eval-print-loop` (defined in `libeval.scm`), which only
provides very basic REPL.  However, if `-q` option isn't given,
`gauche.interactive` is loaded first which shadows `read-eval-print-loop`,
so that `gauche.interactive#read-eval-print-loop` is invoked instead.

While loading `gauche.interactive`, `make-editable-reader` of
`gauche.inetractive.editable-reader` is invoked.  It tries to get
a default console by `text.console#make-default-console`.  If it can,
it returns four values - A procedure to read an S-expr, to read a line,
a thunk to skip trailing whitespaces, and `<line-edit-context>`.
The returned readers are line-edit enabled.

The first three procedures are passed to `gauche.interactive#make-repl-reader`,
which returns a reader that (1) recognizes top-level REPL commands,
and (2) consume trailing whitespaces after S-expression input.

If line editing is not enabled (by `-fno-line-edit` option, or from
an enviornment variable), or `make-editable-reader` can't obtain
a default console, a repl reader is creaded with
`(make-repl-reader read read-line consume-trailing-whitespaces)`.
Thus, it recognizes the toplevel REPL commands, but does not use
line editing.
