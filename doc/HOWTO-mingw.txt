A note on Windows/MinGW support

Now you can compile Gauche to use MinGW runtime library.  It is
the recommended way to build Gauche on Windows.  (You may still be
able to build with Cygwin but it has a few quirks that interfere
with Gauche that may surprise you.)

Because of the difference of the underlying system, not all
system-related procedures are available on MinGW port.
The reference manual tells whether a particular procedure
is supported on "Windows native".

As of 0.9.5, the official Windows binaries are built with
mingw-w64 (see http://mingw-w64.org/ ).  It may still be
built with the original MinGW, but our support efforts are
prioritized in favor of mingw-w64.  By 'MinGW version' in
the following sections, we mean Gauche built with mingw-w64.


[Compilation]

To compile MinGW version from the source tarball, you need MSYS2
environment in order to run 'configure'.   (You don't need MSYS2 to
run the compiled Gauche.)  See https://github.com/msys2 for
the details.

If you try to build from git source, you also need a running
Gauche. Grab one of the precompiled mingw binary, or first build
and install Gauche from the tarball.

The following MinGW libraries are also recommended, although
you can build Gauche without them.

- libiconv    Required to make gauche.charconv fully functional.
- zlib        Required to make rfc.zlib.

Gdbm doesn't work straightforwardly, since there's no official
MinGW port of gdbm.  MSYS-gdbm does NOT work.  You may be
able to compile gdbm from source on MinGW (you need some patches;
look for them the Net.  It is also said that you have to configure
it with --disable-shared.)  Once you have MinGW gdbm installed,
Gauche's 'configure' will find it and builds dbm.gdbm etc,
though some test errors result.

[Installtaion and packaging]

If you want to copy compiled Gauche to the machine where
mingw might not exist, you need to include mingw DLL
(and zlib DLL if you compiled with zlib).  There's a
convenience shell script in src/mingw-dist.sh.   Just run
it on the top of the Gauche source directory, and it will
create a directory ../Gauche-mingw-dist and installs compiled
Gauche into it, with MinGW dlls.
