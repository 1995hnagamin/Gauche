Building iOS framework

You can build Gauche as an iOS framework, so that you can evaluate
Gauche code within iPhone and iPad app.  This is still an experimental
feature, so cross your fingers to proceed.

Note: It doesn't mean you can build iPhone app with Gauche---the
created framework doesn't know anything about ObjC or other
runtime on iOS, so although you can use most of Gauche functionalities
including system functions, you can't create, say, UIViewController
from Gauche code.  We're working on that part and it would be a
separate framework.

1. Build and install Gauche on your OSX machine as usual.
   The build script for iOS needs the HEAD version of Gauche which
   is running on OSX.

2. In $(top_srcdir), run src/cross-compile-ios.scm:

   $ gosh src/cross-compile-ios.scm

   This runs cross compiler for various arm architectures and
   x86 (for the emulator), link them together and put the resulting
   framework under build-ios/Gauche-iOS-core.framework.

3. You can just copy Gauche-iOS-core.framework to wherever
   suits you.

4. In your App, add Gauche-iOS-core.framework in the framework
   section.  You can use Gauche functions by including gauche.h
   as follows:

   #import <Gauche-iOS-core/gauche.h>

   You need to call GC_INIT() and Scm_Init(GAUCHE_SIGNATURE)
   somewhere in your app, before using any other Gauche functions.

   NB: Gauche requires Gauche VM to be attached to the thread
   the Gauche API is called.  If you're in a thread that iOS created,
   it's likely that there's no Gauche VM.  You should call
   Scm_AttachVM() within the thread (but that feature is way less
   tested; expect some rough road.)
