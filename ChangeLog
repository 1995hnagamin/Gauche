2002-04-17  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* src/class.c (scheme_slot_index) : damn it!  this routine has
	  returned bogus index that causes illegal memory access.  It's
	  a wonder that it hasn't revealed until now.  This was the reason
	  of the bug described in the entry below.
	* src/string.c, src/gauche.h: a snapshot of improving dynamic string
	  handling by avoiding realloc.   NB: this version contains a nasty
	  memory bug.

	* src/bignum.c : further optimization.
	
2002-04-13  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* src/number.c (double_print): switched back to the MP version
	  of Burger&Dybvig, for it was difficult to get the consistent
	  result by flonum version on multiple platforms.
	* src/bignum.c : fixed a bug in bignum_gdiv that missed a carry
	  in some occasion.

2002-04-12  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>
	
	* configure.in, src/gauche/config.h.in : added a test for alloca().
	* src/bignum.c, src/number.c : adding denormalized bignum APIs.

	  complex return (imag==0.0 coerced to flonum).
	* src/extlib.stub : added min&max.

2002-04-10  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* src/number.c : number reader/writer passes r4rstest.

2002-04-08  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	  (write* '#()).   Thanks for HAbe to point this out.

2002-04-07  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* src/number.c : modified Burger&Dybvig algorithm to use floating-
	  point arithmetic instead of multiple-precision integer arithmetic.
	  The routine doesn't work for very small numbers yet.

2002-04-05  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* src/number.c : naively implemented Burger&Dybvig printing algorithm.
	  This is just an experiment to see how it works.

2002-04-04  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* src/number.c : fixed read_real to avoid underflow of reading
	  very small numbers.  still needs to work on denormalized flonum

	  number decode routine.

2002-04-03  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* lib/gauche/numerical.scm, src/gauche-init.scm, src/stlib.stub :
	  changed 'make-polar' to a subr from a Scheme-defined function,
          since the result of make-polar didn't exactly match the
	  result of polar representation (<real>@<real>) on x86, because of
	  the Intel's 80-bit floating-point arithmetic, and which was
	  confusing.

2002-04-01  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* configure.in : search slib from /usr/share/slib first, for
	  it appears to be the default location of slib installation.
	* lib/slib.scm.in : incorporated the changes of the slib2d3's
	  Template.scm

2002-03-30  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* src/gauche-init.scm, lib/slib.scm.in : fixed a problem with

	* configure.in, src/gauche/config.h.in : added --with-pthread.
	* src/vm.c, src/vm.h : adding pthread support.

	* release 0.5.2
	* Gauche.spec : added.

	  "rm -f foo; echo ... > foo" still sometimes failed, so removed rm.

2002-03-06  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* ext/auxsyslib.stub : removed sys-setpgrp, for the function 
	  prototype differs among platforms.  it is redundant anyways.

	  from the scheme module for autoload to work.
	* lib/Makefile.in : fixed installation of file/filter.scm and
	  gauche/interpolate.scm.

2002-02-21  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

2002-02-15  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* aclocal.m4 : the rule to generate *_head.c and *_tail.c in
	  configure sometimes fails on cygwin, where the timing of
	  "rm" and following "echo" seems to create a race condition.
	  Fixed to guarantee "rm" is executed before "echo".

2002-02-14  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	  backward compatibility, -fcompat-0.5 command-line option is
	  added.

	  load path.
	* configure.in : recovered GOSH_USE_SHLIB substitution that was
	  accidentally dropped.

	* src/gauche-config.h : autoloads srfi-0 (cond-expand).
	* ext/net/configure.in, ext/net/netconfig.h.in, ext/net/net.h :

	* various files: added support for cygwin (not finished yet).
	  gosh is now built using libgauche.so, instead of statically

	* release 0.5

2002-01-29  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	  bound to the entire form (including foo) but it was
	  inconsisntent with tranditional Scheme implementation and also
	  with (define-macro (foo . args) ...) form.   Now args receives
	  the arguments of foo, as expected.
