[Quick Start]
-------------

   % ./configure
   % make
   % make test
   % make install

Things will be installed under /usr/local/{bin,lib}, and /usr/local/lib/gauche.



[Customizing install location]
------------------------------

Call configure with those parameters.

   % ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX  --exec-prefix=$EXEC_PREFIX


If --prefix option is omitted, /usr/local is assumed as PREFIX.
If --exec-prefix option is omitted, EXEC_PREFIX is set the same as PREFIX.

The files are installed in those locations:

  $EXEC_PREFIX/bin/*
     The interpreter (gosh) and configuration script (gauche-config).

  $EXEC_PREFIX/lib/*
     Library (libgauche.a).   Actually, it's a symlink to

  $PREFIX/share/gauche/VERSION/include/*
     Header files required to create applications using libgauche.

  $PREFIX/share/gauche/VERSION/lib/*
     Machine-independent scheme files.

  $PREFIX/share/gauche/VERSION/ARCHITECTURE/*
     Machine-dependent files (.so files, gosh, gauche-config, and libgauche.a)

  $PREFIX/share/gauche/site/lib/*
  $PREFIX/share/gauche/site/ARCHITECTURE/*
     These are default locations where user installed machine-indenepdent/
     dependent files will go.


One of the common situation is that the directories containing
architecture dependent files are mounted on different volumes on
the different machines.  Suppose each machine has the following
mounting scheme:

  /usr/bin, /usr/lib -> mounted to architecture-specific disks
  /usr/share -> mounted to the common disk.

Then call ./configure as follows;

  ./configure --prefix=/usr
