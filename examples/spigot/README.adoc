This directory contains sources of `spigot` extension module,
as an example of Gauche extension.

This extension isn't built by default.  You can build it
_after installing Gauche_.  See below.

The sources include:

[horizontal]
`package.scm`::		package metainformation
`configure`::		configure script
`Makefile.in`::		template makefile
`spigot.h`::		common declaration within the spigot module
`spigot-lib.c`::	main logic
`spigot.scm`::		Scheme binding of the module
`test.scm`::		unit test

This is a typical construction of a simple extension.  Note that
you can generate the skeletons of these files automatically,
by `gauche-package` script:

[source,console]
----
% gauche-package generate spigot
----

It is a good way to start writing a fresh extension; but now
we already have the sources, so let's move on.

To build the extension, you have to generate `Makefile` by
running the configure script.

[source,console]
----
% ./configure
----

The configure script automatically finds installed Gauche,
and picks the right options to compile and link.
Now, `make` builds the extension, `make check` runs
the test, and `make install` installs the extension
in the Gauche's standard location.

[source,console]
----
% make
% make check
% make install
----
