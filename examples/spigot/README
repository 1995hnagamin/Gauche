This directory contains sources of "spigot" extension module.
You can use these files as a template of your extension.

The extension isn't built by default.  You can build the
extension _after installing Gauche_.  See below.

The sources include:

  configure.in   - source of "configure" script
  Makefile.in    - template makefile
  spigot.h       - common declaration within the spigot module
  spigot.c       - main logic 
  spigot.stub    - a "stub" file to generate Scheme-C glue
  spigot.scm     - Scheme part of the module
  test.scm       - unit test

This is a typical construction of a simple extension.

As a developer, you have to start from generating "configure"
script by autoconf.   You need autoconf version 2.54 or later.
This command creates "configure" from configure.in.

  % autoconf -I `gauche-config --ac`

Once configure is generated, you can create Makefile by
running configure script.

  % ./configure

Configure script automatically finds installed Gauche,
and picks right options to compile and link.
Now, 'make' builds the extension, 'make check' runs
the test, and 'make install' installs the extension
in the Gauche's standard location.

  % make
  % make check
  % make install
