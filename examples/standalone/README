This directory contains code to show how to build a statically-linked
gauche binary, that can run stand-alone (that is, you don't need to
install Gauche runtime separately---everything is in one executable).

This is still an experimental feature.  The building process isn't
streamlined: You need manual tweak depending on your configuration.
Also there's no easy way yet to statically link external Gauche
extensions such as Gauche-gl.  We'll gradually address these issues.


[1. Prerequisites]

You need to compile and install the Gauche from the source
(at this moment, the build process uses features added after
the last release 0.9.3.3, so you need to install development head
version of gauche; this will change once we release 0.9.4.)

[2. Build a static library]

Clean the source tree and run configure with appropriate options,
then build Gauche as usual.

  Note: If you intend to distribute the compiled binary, be aware
  that if you link gdbm, the binary is covered by GPL.
  If you want to 

Then, in $(TOP_SRCDIR)/src, run 'make static'.
This builds libgauche-0.9.a.

[3. Bundle your script source]

Run make-standalone script.  It will be something like this:

  ./make-standalone -o command yourscript.scm -lz
