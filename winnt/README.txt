This directory contains files to compile Gauche with VisualC++ on Windows.

If you get the source tree from the preprocessed Windows source zip
(Gauche-x.x.x-winsrc.zip), just open Gauche.sln and build the solution.

If you get the source tree from the standard tarball (Gauche-x.x.x.tgz)
or from CVS, you have to preprocess the source tree.  You need a unix-
compatible environment (such as cygwin) to do that.  Go up to the source
top directory and run "./DIST winvc".
