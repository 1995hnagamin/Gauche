This file is for those who wants to hack the cutting-edge
Gauche sources in CVS repository.  If you just want to
compile from the distribution, you don't need to read any further.

Gauche has adopted automake and libtool.
In order to build Gauche from CVS sources, instead of from
distribution, you need to have the following tools:

  automake 1.4-p5
  libtool 1.4.2
  autoconf 2.53

Greater versions might work, although automake is known
to have compatibility issues around 1.5.

CVS source tree doesn't include some files that comes with
autotools.  Run the "DIST" script in the toplevel directory
with "gen" argument:

  % ./DIST gen

It is like "autogen.sh" found in some opensource packages.
This creates missing files, including libltdl, and then
runs aclocal, automake and autoconf in the source tree
to generate Makefile.in's and configure's.  You need to
run "./DIST gen" whenever you change one of Makefile.am's.
