This file is for those who wants to hack the cutting-edge
Gauche sources from the CVS repository.  If you just want to
compile from the distribution, you don't need to read any further.

In order to build Gauche from the CVS sources, instead of from
the distribution, you need to have autoconf 2.54 or higher.
The author using autoconf 2.57.

You also need to have the latest Gauche installed on your
machine, for it is required to generate some C files.

The CVS source tree doesn't include "configure" scripts.
You can use the DIST script like the following to generate them.

  % ./DIST gen


Note for seasoned libtool/automake users: the CVS source tree
includes files that are usually generated automatically by
autotools, such as aclocal.m4, ltmain.sh, src/gauche/config.h.in,
etc.  Be careful not to clobber these files.  First, if your
autotools version doesn't match mine, it tends to break.
Second, those files are likely to be edited after generated,
in order to fix some build problem on certain platform.
