Gauche is a Scheme scripting engine aiming at being a handy tool that helps
programmers and system administrators to write small to large scripts quickly.

Visit the project webpage https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/ for more details.

If you're new to this project and want to try compiling from git repo,
check link:HACKING.adoc[] first.  If it is your first time to build Gauche, you should
start from the release tarball instead of git clone; see
https://practical-scheme.net/gauche/download.html on how to get the tarball.
Once you get and untar the release tarball, see link:INSTALL.adoc[] in it for the instructions.
