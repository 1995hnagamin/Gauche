This directory contains test text files in Japanese and Korean,
with various encodings.

jp1 : one-line kanji text 
jp2 : one-line kanji, kana (jisx0201-kana), latin mixed.
      intentionally missing newline at the end.
jp3 : long kanji text, containing long lines.

kr1 : one-line hangul text

Text in some encodings are automatically generated from the 'base'
encoding (EUC).  Makefile describes the rule, but it may not work
on your environment.
