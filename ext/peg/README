Originally written by Rui Ueyama.  The original (pure Scheme) version
is kept as peg-orig.scm for a reference; it is cleaner than the final
optimized version so it'd be easier to understand.

benchmark.scm and prof.scm are for tuning.  They use a sample data file
data/13tokyo.cvs, which is a public domain data provided by Japanese
Postal Service.
