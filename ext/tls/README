This module contains a modified source files of axTLS.
Here's how to incorporate a new version of axTLS.

Suppose $(AXTLS) as the new axTLS source tree.

(1) Copy the following files/directories into axTLS/
   $(AXTLS)/Makefile
   $(AXTLS)/ssl/
   $(AXTLS)/crypto/

(2) Apply the patch axtls.diff.  You man need to tweak some
    files (esp. axTLS/config/config.h)

     patch -p0 < axtls.diff

(3) Compile and run tests.  Tweak the source if needed.

(4) Regenerate axtls.diff by the following command:

     gosh ./axtls-diff.scm $(AXTLS) > axtls.diff
