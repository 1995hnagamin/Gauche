This directory contains several Scheme files useful for testing.

r4rstest.scm - taken from SCM distribution by Aubrey Jaffer.
    This file is under GPL.
    Gauche fails in the following tests:
      * A test which alters global binding of '+' (since Gauche compiler
        inlines '+' by default.)
      * Tests involving bignums and float number formatting
      * A test using string->symbol and symbol->string.  I haven't
        figured out why this fails.

nqueen.scm - A solver of N-queen problem, written by Yusuke SHINYAMA
    (http://tanaka-www.cs.titech.ac.jp/%7Eeuske/).
    I'm using this for naive benchmark.

dynwind.scm - A test of dynamic-wind and call/cc.  The first function
    in it is taken from R5RS example.

primsyn.scm - A naive test for compiler.
