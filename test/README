This directory contains several Scheme files useful for testing.

r4rstest.scm - taken from SCM distribution by Aubrey Jaffer.
    This file is under GPL.
    Gauche fails in the following tests:
      * A test which alters global binding of '+' (since Gauche compiler
        inlines '+' by default.)
      * Tests involving bignums and float number formatting

nqueen.scm - A solver of N-queen problem, written by Yusuke SHINYAMA
    (http://tanaka-www.cs.titech.ac.jp/%7Eeuske/).
    I'm using this for naive benchmark.

Other scheme files comform Gauche's standard test protocol.
Run "make test" in src directory to run those tests.
