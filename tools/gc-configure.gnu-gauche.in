# This is invoked by the main configure script, via gc/configure.gnu,
# which allows us to intercept the call to gc/configure to override
# some options.

# "--enable-threads=..."
#   [SK] Original Boehm GC checks gcc for the default thread support.
#   In our case we need the thread config in sync with the main Gauche
#   source tree.
#
# "-DDONT_ADD_BYTE_AT_END", "--enable-large-config"
#   [SK] this is _required_ to make Gauche work correctly.
#
# "--enable-handle-fork"
#   [SK] this supposed to make GC in forked children work on OSX; it did
#   work on OSX 10.7.3, but caused various failures on 10.7.4, so I disable
#   it again.

# NB: The parent configure sets SHELL with their CONFIG_SHELL
